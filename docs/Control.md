# Position Control for Tello Drone 

This document describes the position control for the Tello drone using the rc(vx, vy, vz, yaw) function available in the Ryze SDK. This position control employs a PI controller, which can be modified depending on the specific drone in use. A proportional gain (P) is then applied, followed by saturation between -20 and 20 for safety reasons during our tests. In theory, the speed range is between -100 and 100.

## Overview

The goal of this system is to control the position of the Tello drone in real-time using Simulink while receiving and processing telemetry data from the drone. The position reference used for our control system is provided by OptiTrack.

1. **Process and Goals:**

    The system provides position control commands to the Tello drone and processes telemetry data. The aim is to ensure precise control of the drone's position using PI control algorithms, with the position reference provided by OptiTrack.


2. **PI Controller for Position Control:**


    The PI controller adjusts the drone's position commands based on the measured position errors. The proportional (P) and integral (I) gains can be adjusted according to the specific characteristics of the drone in use.

3. **Command Saturations:**

    The speed commands generated by the PI controller are then passed through a saturation block to ensure they remain between -20 and 20, thus ensuring safe movements of the drone. Although the theoretical speed range is between -100 and 100, it is limited for safety reasons during testing.

4. **Command Saturations:**

    The position control for each axis is stopped independently when the drone is within a circle of radius 10 cm around the predefined waypoint. This ensures precise positioning and prevents unnecessary adjustments once the drone is within the desired area.

    **Conclusion**

    The Simulink block for Tello drone position control provides a comprehensive solution for controlling and monitoring the drone's position. With its real-time processing capabilities and seamless integration, it is ideal for various applications, including autonomous navigation and aerial monitoring. The position reference for our control system is provided by OptiTrack, ensuring accurate and reliable positioning data. The control system also includes a mechanism to stop position adjustments independently on each axis when within a 10 cm radius of the waypoint, enhancing precision and stability.
